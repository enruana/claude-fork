🗑️ Clean Claude Fork Data

The clean command consists of these two options:

**1. Clean Forks** (Database entries)
   - Cleans the fork database entries
   - Command: `claude-fork clean-forks`

**2. Clean Exports** (Files)
   - Removes export files from disk
   - Command: `claude-fork clean-exports`

**3. Clean Everything**
   - Cleans both forks and exports
   - Command: `claude-fork clean-forks --force && claude-fork clean-exports --force`

Would you like me to execute any of these options?

Respond with:
- `1` to clean only forks
- `2` to clean only exports
- `3` to clean everything
- `cancel` to cancel

Which option would you prefer?
