📤 **Automatic Export with Task Management**

I'll add two tasks to my task list and execute them automatically:

1. **Generate export summary** for this Claude Fork session with name: $ARGUMENTS
2. **Save the export** to file: `~/.claude-forks/exports/$ARGUMENTS.md`

Let me add these tasks now and execute them sequentially.
